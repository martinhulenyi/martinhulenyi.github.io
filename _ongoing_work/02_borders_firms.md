## Abstract
Borders can act as barriers to regional development, limiting the market potential of firms located there. Drawing on location theory \citep{losch1944}, which likens border regions to deserts attracting only smaller firms, this paper investigates the impact of the borders on firms in regions affected by the 2004 EU enlargement. Using firm-level data, we analyze both internalized borders and the external borders of New Member States (NMS) and their EU15 neighbors. Our results suggest lower growth of profitability for firms located in border areas between a NMS country and a EU15 country. We further find heterogeneity across firms sizes and sectors.



## Motivation 
- The EU invested in the 2007-2013 237 million Euros in Slovak hospitals, in a country that lags behind other EU countries in preventive healthcare and quality of primary healthcare provision
- Lack of empirical evidence on the effect of EU Funds on healthcare quality in the EU

## Research question
- Do the EU Funds increase the quality of healthcare in Slovakia?
- What is the impact of subcategories of EU Funds (infrastructure, equipment, and personnel and other expenses)?

## Contribution
- Empirical analysis of the impact of EU Funds on quality of healthcare

## Empirical strategy
- Estimating the impact of EU Funds on healthcare quality outcomes of Slovak hospitals (67 hospitals, of which 30 received EU Funds at some point) in 2010-2017
- **Dependent variables**: readmission and mortality rtes 
- **Variable of interest**: EU Funds in Euros (overall, infrastructure, equipment, and personnel and other expenses)
- **Control variables**: hospital level (capacity, occupancy, perinatal mortality, having intensive care or oncology sections, number of CT and MR machines, stae or private hospital or regional hospital) and regional level controls (average wage, old age dependency ratio, Roma share)
- **Method**: OLS

## Results
- negative impact of lagged EU funds on readmission rate in hospitals, although econominically insignificant
- this effect is mainly driven by construction and reconstruction of hospitals
- investment into equipment results in higher readmission rate (could be the case of hospitals becoming more important and receiving more acute patients)
- no effect of EU Funds on mortality rates

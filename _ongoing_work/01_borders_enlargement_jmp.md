## Job market paper ##
In this paper, I use the Eastern EU enlargements as a quasi-experiment to assess the impact of integration on the border areas. As such, I compare the growth of night-time light emissions in urban municipalities close to the treated borders  to municipalities located  in the interior of the same countries applying staggered differences-in-differences approach. I find a positive average treatment effect for urban municipalities that are part of the 2004 EU enlargement and bordering other  countries of the 2004 expansion cohort. Moreover, my results indicate the  importance of anticipation, as economic activity increased in the 2004 new member states near borders with EU15 before EU accession. The positive impact on the 2004 enlargement also shows the importance of market access. Smaller urban municipalities of the 2007 enlargement display an enhanced economic development in comparison to the hinterland. Also, it seems that proximity to borders made up of mountains or rivers might restrict the positive impact of EU accession for border areas.



## Abstract
In this paper, I use the Eastern EU enlargements as a quasi-experiment to assess the impact of integration on the border areas. As such, I compare the growth of night-time light emissions in urban municipalities close to the treated borders  to municipalities located  in the interior of the same countries applying staggered differences-in-differences approach. I find a positive average treatment effect for urban municipalities that are part of the 2004 EU enlargement and bordering other  countries of the 2004 expansion cohort. Moreover, my results indicate the  importance of anticipation, as economic activity increased in the 2004 new member states near borders with EU15 before EU accession. The positive impact on the 2004 enlargement also shows the importance of market access. Smaller urban municipalities of the 2007 enlargement display an enhanced economic development in comparison to the hinterland. Also, it seems that proximity to borders made up of mountains or rivers might restrict the positive impact of EU accession for border areas.

## Motivation 
- Borders limit the trade between countries (McCallum, 1995) and development of the areas adjacent to them (Redding and Sturm, 2008; Fantechi and Fratesi, 2022).
- Removing the barriers to trade results in growth of border areas (Brülhart et al., 2018; Brakman et al., 2012; Mitze and Breidenbach, 2024).

## Research questions
- Do border urban municipalities benefit more from the Eastern EU enlargements in comparison to urban municipalities in the hinterland?
- What factors facilitate the benefits of Eastern EU enlargements for urban border municipalities?
## Contributions
- Taking a advantage of accessible yearly data on proxy of economic activity (nighttime lights (NTL), (Li et al., 2020)) to combine granular approach (urban municipalities) with spatial broadness (all countries of the Eastern enlargements and their EU15 neighbors).
- Use of state of the art causal inference methods (Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021) to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.

## Empirical strategy
- Comparison of urban municipalities located in the proximity of the borders (0-25 km) to the ones located in the hinterland (50-100 km)  
- **Dependent variables**: remain votes and voter turnout in the 2016 Brexit referendum (in %), results for the major parties (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP) in the 2017 parliamentary elections  
- **Method**: Staggered difference-in-differences 

## Results
- positive correlation between the remain votes and the Cohesion Policy payments on the NUTS3 level
- negative correlation between the EU Funds and the turnout in the 2016 referendum on the NUTS3 level
- positive correlation between the EU Funds and the votes for the Labour party in the 2017 elections
- negative correlation between the EU Funds and the votes for the Conservative party in the 2017 elections
